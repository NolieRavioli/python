# Intro
These programs interact with Carrier Command 2.

# modCompare.py
This program helped me create a couple modpacks for the game since there is almost no modding support in the game.

# modifyItems.py
This program uses hex editing to hack the game .exe and give different attributes to different core items.

# sidenote:
Other modders were talking a lot about the ability to load new files into the game through exe editing. Going back through the discord convos I had, I think it might be possible to add new files to the game exe through hex editing.
